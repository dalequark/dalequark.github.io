I'm currently working on a Brain Computer Interface that, using EEG data, decides whether a participant is viewing a face or a place, and in turn gives them neurofeedback to help them better focus on one or the other.  In the process, I've built a framework for running experiments in Java + Python + the browser.  You can view the code [here](https://github.com/dalequark/emotivExperiment).  More details to come soon. Stay tuned!
