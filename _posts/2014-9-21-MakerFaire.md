title: Maker Faire 2014, NYC

Maker Faire has changed dramatically since my last visit in 2012, which was to be expected
since the same goes for electronics prototyping as a whole.  Back in 2012, RadioShack might
sell the Arduino Uno and maybe a single shield.  

The most interesting change in Maker Faire this year, in my mind, are the 3D printing displays.
On my first visit, the 3D printing tent consisted of n-thousand different types of 3D printers,
but frankly, after you've seen one you've seen them all.  This year, it was easy to see that
hobbyists had evolved from "Who can make the coolest 3D printer" to "what neat things can I do
now that I have one?"  Some of my favorite applications of 3D printing are below:
