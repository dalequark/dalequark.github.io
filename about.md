![brain]({{site.url}}/images/dalebrain.png)

  My name is Dale, and I study Computer Science at Princeton University
(class of 2015).  I'm interested in all sorts of stuff, from tinkering
around with hardware to building
[brain-computer interfaces]({{site.url}}/neuromancer) to figuring out how
to use machine learning techniques to better analyze the data I get from the
noisy sensors on hardware devices.
  I'm also interested in exploring how I can use DIY fabrication/protoyping
techniques to make my own, personal life more fun and future-y.
  I'm from the east coast and I love coffee.
